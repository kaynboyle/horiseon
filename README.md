# horiseon
code refactor for horizon website 
The assignment was to make the horiseon website more acessible; that was accomplished by changing the "div soup" or many div tags to more semantic tags that are easily read by screen readers that people who are disabled might need to use to understand a web page. Tags like "alt" to describe images or "nav" to show where the navigation links are on the page are helpful acessability features for a website to have.
